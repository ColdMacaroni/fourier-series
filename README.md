# fourier-series
This branch will be dedicated to making this program use a complex plane instead of a normal one

This also means the circles will be calculated using complex numbers. It should be the last step before being able to create a fourier series from any image

Soon to be adding support for a bunch of svgs! Stay tuned!

## Rn only svgs composed fully of cubic relative beziers are supported by the generate starting conditions file

SO uh yeah i made a circle in pygame

I had to learn calculus against my will

Trying to use objects!
